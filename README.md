### Parcel Watcher issue
This basic repo is to demo a `@parcel/watcher` issue when updating a file, it constantly triggers 2 update events every single time. My environment is on Windows and I'm not sure if this happens on other environments.

#### Installation
1. `npm install`
2. open the file `index.html` and Save the file
   - 2 update events are triggered and logged in the terminal
